## Environments

This project is for local running only.

## Aims of the project

- Fetch data from the Twitter API to display tweets
- Be able to see tweets like they appear in Twitter
- Be able to like or retweet a tweet.
- Be able to create a tweet with an image
  - The image could be from the camera
  - The image could be from the photo library
- Be able to geotag a tweet

### Not in scope

executed. -->
